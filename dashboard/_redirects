# API Proxy Rules - Route API calls through Netlify
# Netlify proxies to FastAPI directly (HTTP), avoiding self-signed cert issue

# Proxy all /api/* requests to FastAPI (HTTP port 8000)
/api/* http://54.225.171.108:8000/api/:splat 200

# SPA redirect fallback
# All non-API routes serve index.html for client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200
