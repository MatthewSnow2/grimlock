# API Proxy Rules - Route API calls through Netlify's HTTPS
# This solves the self-signed certificate issue by proxying through Netlify

# Proxy all /api/* requests to FastAPI via Caddy (HTTPS)
/api/* https://54.225.171.108:443/api/:splat 200

# SPA redirect fallback
# All non-API routes serve index.html for client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200
